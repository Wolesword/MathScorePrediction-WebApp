### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

This code was just to see how I could predict the performance of students based on some basic available information. 

Please enjoy!

The code contains:
- ðŸ”­ The data contains basic information such as gender, race, parent_education, lunch and test preparation.
- ðŸŒ± The model is stored in a pickle file for reuse
- ðŸ‘¯ A summary statistics is performed on the modelling
- ðŸ¤” Plots are generated for visualisation
- ðŸ’¬ And some insight on the data gained.

It is still a work in progress and open to suggestions. 

Launch the web app, feel free to interact with the parameters:
